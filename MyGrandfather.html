On rare occasions in our lives, we come across a personality so outstanding, that the only question we can ask god is “God, if you ever plan to grant me a wish, please make me like him”. For me, Jivanlal Shah, my Grandfather, whom his grandchildren lovingly called “Daddy” and whom his children lovingly and respectfully referred to as “Motai”, was one such man. I have had the immense luck and pleasure of staying with him, serving him, learning from him, and interacting with him for pretty much my entire life. I am here to say a few words about someone who was, is and will always be an inspirational figure for every one of us. 
<br/>
<br/>
His journey began in the village of Vaghodia (a small village on the outskirts of Baroda, a city in Gujarat, India). Born as the eldest son of Chandanben and Girdharlal Shah, his zest for life, his curiosity to learn new things and his ambition to achieve something remarkable made him overcome a lot of hurdles and obstacles. And in those days when people barely reached the 10th Grade of schools, he became a Lawyer.
<br/>
<br/>
He was actively involved in India’s freedom struggle as a freedom fighter under Mahatma Gandhi during the 1942 Quit India Movement, and I would not be exaggerating if I say that it is because of the contribution of people like Jivanlal Shah during the formative years of India that India today enjoys a position of a powerful democracy and a force to be reckoned with. In fact one of his biggest contributions was in the “MahaGujarat” movement after India's independence when the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra had to be separated. He even went to jail for this purpose. He was also actively involved in the political scenario of Gujarat. He served as the President of the All India Peace and Solidarity Organization, and even attended the World Peace Conference twice. He was a legal advisor to a number of big organizations and was a trustee of the "Sastu Sahitya Trust" and "Akhand Anand".
<br/>
<br/>
To this date, the lawyers and judges of the High Court of Gujarat consider him to be one of the best in the profession. So precise were his arguments while at the court that it left the opposition lawyers shocked and amazed at the same time. But I am not surprised that he was such a good lawyer, for I have seen him go through his daily rounds of immaculate preparation. The zeal with which he studied each case, considering every minute detail of the case, and the hard work that he put in for each of his clients was just amazing. Behind his smiling face was a mind of steel. Even the cruelest of criminals came out cold if they tried to intimidate or scare him or his family.  He was also elected as the President of the Bar Association of the High Court of Gujarat, the first time in the history of the State that a person was elected uncontested. He was well known in the High Court as a Lawyer who always fought for the lower class workers and refused to accept cases against the workers. Some of his clients would often remark, "I would rather be hanged till death than have someone other than Jivanlal Shah fight my case".
<br/>
<br/>
He was someone who in Gujarati we say “Bhulakana”. As my Father would joke about him, “Motai ne ghar no phone-number yaad na rahe, pan law ni “Kalam” ekdum tip of the tongue hoy”. <i>(Rarely was he ever able to remember his home phone number. But such was his passion for his profession that he remembered the codes of the various laws till the very end.)</i> In fact I can still remember him fighting cases and debating with the Judges even in his sleep.
<br/>
<br/>
When me and my sister would not study and my Mom would try to scold us, my GrandFather would joke: “Bhanya to Doctor ke Engineer  thasho, na bhanya to Mantri thasho.” 
<i>(A sarcastic remark, meaning, "If you study hard, you might end up being a Doctor or an Engineer, but if you don't study you will be able to become an influential Minister". Quite a few Minister's in India in those days were uneducated)</i> And me and my sister, out of the prospect of ending up being a Minister, would get back to study.
<br/>
<br/>
An enthusiastic food lover, no wonder the bhajiya and fafda stalls and ice-cream parlors in the localities of Sharda Talkies, Jalvihar Flats and Satyagraha Chhavni depended heavily on Jivanlal for their business.
<br/>
<br/>
Although a religious and spiritual person, he was not religious in the general sense of the term. He never prayed regularly or did “Upvaas” <i>(Fasting)</i>. Instead of the Hindu deities, one is more likely to find a portrait of great men like Swami Vivekananda in his bedroom. He had read all the religious books including the Gita, Kuran and the Bible innumerable times. But to me, he was a true Hindu, for he believed that his religion was “helping others”.
<br/>
<br/>
In spite of all his success, he never forgot his roots. He fully understood his responsibilities towards the community. Education being one of his prime passions, he helped construct a school with modern facilities in his native village of Vaghodia. The school today accomodates about 1500 students. He also served as the Chairman of “Shaada Sanchalan Samiti” for a number of years. 
<br/>
<br/>
He was addicted to reading. He would read each and every type of literature, be it about law, politics, religion, medicine, history, economics, science, philosophy; almost anything that he could get his hands on. Such was his appetite for learning that he wanted to study law in the US even at the age of 79. So passionate and curious was he that even after his health faltered a bit, he would rush to the basement of our house, where his large and rich personal library of about 25,000 books (and that number does not even include his collection of books related to Law, we had a different library in the office which had 10,000 books on Law) dwelled, to read more and more. My father had to literally block the entrance to our basement, so as to avoid any injury to my Grandfather. The words of Erasmus, "When I get a little
money I buy books; and if any is left I buy food and clothes." could not have suited
anyone more than Jivanlal Shah.<br/>
<br/>
In the later part of his life, he became very interested in Homeopathy. And as with his skills as a lawyer, he became one of the finest Homeopathic Advisors, even better than the Doctors. He treated thousands of patients and all of them were treated free of cost. He even wrote a book (in Gujarati) on the subject of Homeopathy. To this date, the book is used as a reference in the Colleges of Gujarat. He also wrote and translated books on other varied subjects including Law, Yoga, Pranayama, and Alternative Medicine.
<br/>
<br/>
Truly, a man is known by the company he keeps. And he really was blessed in that he was always surrounded by highly intellectual and trustworthy friends. His circle of close friends included Doctors, Lawyers, Teachers, Politicians, Writers, Poets, Farmers, successful Businessmen and heavyweight Government Officials. He was a man of varied colors. An avid and voracious reader, a smart and gutsy lawyer, a compassionate social worker, a natural homeopath and a loving family man. But the quality I most appreciate in him was that he never considered himself an expert, but a keen and curious student of the subjects he was interested in. "Live life to the fullest, but never waste a minute" seemed to be his philosophy.
<br/>
<br/>
He had this aura about him, some sort of invisible energy. Any room he walked into, he would liven up the atmosphere and would bring a sense of happiness and serenity with his infectious smile, his gregarious nature, and his smooth talking style. "Mane vadhta hoy to pan mane evu laage ke maara vakhaan kari rahya chhe". <i>(He was such a good speaker that even if he was scolding me, I would feel as if I am being praised.)</i>
<br/>
<br/>
Of course behind his success lies the immense hard work and support of his family. In particular I would like to thank my Grandmother, Late Madhukanta Jivanlal Shah and my Father Harshad Shah. I would also like to thank my family and our family friends, but most of all I would like to thank my Parents, Harshad Shah and Meena Shah for the selfless service and loving care they offered to my Grandfather.
<br/>
<br/>
He had high hopes from the people of his family. I hope that we can live up to his expectations and do something outstanding for the community.
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to end this tribute with a line from one of my Grandfathers favorite songs:
“Jene banavyo ene hoon banavya karu chhu, chalya karu chhu, chalya karu chhu”
<i>(I keep making (fooling) the God who made me, I keep walking along, I keep walking along.)</i>
<br/>
<br/>
His name “Jivan” literally means life, and he lives in our memory forever, constantly showering blessing s on us. Such a life should not be mourned; it has to be cherished and enjoyed for generations to come. His legacy continues and his values and principles will stay with us forever. 
<br/>
<br/>
Jivanlal G. Shah, a rare mix of humility, humbleness, guts, and passion.
<br/>
My Grandfather, My Inspiration, My Hero.
